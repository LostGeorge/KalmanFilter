# Data Assimilation in Climate Models - Kalman Filtering

#### George Hu, Charles Parker

Done under the guidance of Charles Parker, as part of Brown's Applied Math Directed Reading Program. This is an exploration of how to combine statistics and dynamical systeem modeling for climate sciences through data assimilation. In this repository,
there are implementations for the Kalman Filter and the Ensemble Kalman Filter applied to an ODE for Earth's Energy Budge and the PDE system Lorenz-96.
